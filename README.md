![Hello, Friend.](https://github.com/AiKuroyake/AiKuroyake/blob/main/hello_friend.png "Hello, Friend.")

Once again: Hello, Friend. 

One of my friends like to creatively think of many nicknames they call me. That's how Májosaurus was made. But really I'm Mája. Nice to meet you!

I asked Midjourney to create a picture of me holding a ThinkPad laptop and waving a hand at you. I got an almostmacbook laptop and weird hands with six fingers. Anyway, a great attempt! Also I think it's better to read about someone's info if you got the face as well. So thank Midjourney for the illustration. Although it doesn' look like me at all. And no, I really do not have six fingers if you ask. Neither I own that hoodie but man I wish I would!

*Sorry, I tried to sound funny but when I'm speaking English I'm probably sounding more cringe than funny. Do you speak Czech? Cause in my native language I'm definitely funnier!*

*If you want to know something more...*

I'm a Computational Linguistics student (because all of my life I haven't known if I'm more a humanities or an IT gal and this way I can be both at the same time). I know Python which I enjoy the most. I started learning C#, Angular and hopefully later this year also R. I'm also interested in databases, mainly MS SQL because that's what I use.

I know nothing about algorithmization and optimal solutions. I'm happy when any of my solutions work.

I like Linux. I used to dualboot it with Windows but the time has come and I decided to use Linux only on my personal computer. I'm running Pop!\_OS if you ask <3

Well, it was nice meeting you... and until next time!

But wait...

Where is the any key?

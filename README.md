Hi there. I'm MÃ¡ja.

I'm a Computational Linguistics student and wannabe IT guy. I know Python and started learning C#. I'm also interested in databases. But I'm still more of a linguist so don't expect me to follow in a technical discussions about the best- and quick-working algorithms <3

I have a love relationship with Linux and a hate relationship with Windows but ofc I can't live without any of the systems. I've been loving Pop!\_OS recently.

Where is the any key?
